* Now that the deck parsing on Heroku works, need to clean bad data.
- write a deamon to delete bad tournaments (or maybe just a one-time task)
  - such as ones with decks with no cards in them
  - or ones with like 100+ cards in them

* web pages!
- kiss first
  - tournament listing page (/tournaments)
  - tournament detail page (/tournament/:id)

* schema work
- add name index to help format/tournament type queries
- are we reindexing in (maybe-setup) unnecessarily?

* better error handling in extractor
- try catch around each extraction
- maybe stack traces in log
- maybe not retry failed tournaments over and over

* get it running daily on Heroku (done!)
- extractor deamon
- retrieve listings
- retrieve tournament ids already in Mongo
- for new listings, extract tournaments and save
- might be nice to log activity (println)
- create a main/executable entry point (lein run :extractor)
- test execution of one-off processes on heroku (heroku run:detached lein run...)
- add scheduler to heroku app and invoke deamon hourly
  -heroku addons:add scheduler
  -heroku addons:open scheduler
